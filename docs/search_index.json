I do not want to keep .md files but I can’t find a way to get rid of them. The contents of the _bookdown.yml file are: output_dir: docs new_session: yes delete_merged_file: true edit: https://github.com/minimumexample/keepmarkdownfalse/edit/master/%s view: https://github.com/minimumexample/keepmarkdownfalse/blob/master/%s and the contents of the _output.yml file are: bookdown::gitbook: keep_md: false yet docs/index.md remains after rendering. (keep_md: false shouldn’t be necessary but tried it just in case. It didn’t help.) The same is the case with bookdown::render_book(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;, new_session = TRUE, clean = TRUE) "]
