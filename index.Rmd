# `new_session: yes` example

The contents of `_bookdown.yml` are:

```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines("_bookdown.yml"))
```

and the contents of `_output.yml` are:

```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines("_output.yml"))
```

yet [`docs/index.md`](https://github.com/minimumexample/keepmarkdownfalse/blob/master/docs/index.md) remains after rendering.

The same is the case with

`bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", new_session = TRUE, clean = TRUE)`

In addition, despite including `delete_merged_file: true`, [`_main.rds`](https://github.com/minimumexample/keepmarkdownfalse/blob/master/_main.rds) remains after rendering.
